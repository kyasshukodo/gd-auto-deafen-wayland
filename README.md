# AutoDeafenWayland

**THIS IS INTENDED PURELY FOR GEOMETRY DASH RUNNING ON WINE/PROTON WITH THE WAYLAND COMPOSITOR. THIS IS NOT EXPECTED TO WORK ON X11**

* It is also important to note that this has only been tested on Arch Linux in the KDE Plasma environment, but I suspect most environments on wayland should be fine.

The Megahack & Geode auto-deafen do not work in Geometry Dash on wayland. This is due to an intentional security feature which blocks global synthetic inputs.
The purpose of this mod is to (hopefully) allow wayland users on Linux lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
